Features
Add a Task: Users can add new tasks to the list.
Delete a Task: Users can remove tasks they no longer need to complete.
Mark as Completed: Users can mark tasks as completed or undo the completed status.
Persistent Data: Tasks are saved in local storage, so they remain available after page reloads.
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes.
